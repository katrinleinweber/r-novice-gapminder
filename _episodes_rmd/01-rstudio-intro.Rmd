## Motivation

Science relies on rigor, openness and transparency. This holds even more in data driven science. R is one out of several ways to ensure these pilars of proper science. To make use of R's capabilites we need to understand the foundations of R and how to efficiently make use of it.

Throughout this lesson, we're going to teach you some of the fundamentals of
the R language. To do so, we'll be using RStudio: a free, open source R integrated development environment. It provides a built in editor, works on all platforms (including on servers) and provides many advantages such as integration with version
control and project management.

## Before Starting The Workshop

Please ensure you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed on your machine. This is important, as some packages used in the workshop may not install correctly (or at all) if R is not up to date.

* [Download and install the latest version of R here](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [Download and install RStudio here](https://www.rstudio.com/)

## Introduction to R

R is a language, a software and a philosophy. R is open, free, transparent and flexible. R is one of the most active (computational) languages/programmes in data science. R can be used for calculations and data visualisation, for image and sound manipulation, for internet and email scraping, to generate interactive reports, to write books and to generate presentations. 

More formally, R is free software for statistics and visualisation. It is an open-source GNU project, based on S (introduced by John Chambers). While it is primarily accessible via command line, it is a high-level, interpreted, functional, object-oriented language.

There are two imporant quotes that underpin many scopes in R:

> Everything that is called in R is a function.

> Everything that is created in R is an object.

Much of your time in R will be spent in the R interactive
console. This is where you will run all of your code, and can be a
useful environment to try out ideas before adding them to a more elaborated script
file.

The first thing you will see in the R interactive session is a bunch
of information, followed by a ">" and a blinking cursor. In many ways
this is similar to the shell environment you learned about during the
shell lessons: it operates on the same idea of a "Read, evaluate,
print loop": you type in commands, R tries to execute them, and then
returns a result.

## Introduction to RStudio

Working just in a console appears a bit boring and less intuitive, no? When you encounter more extensive problems, you may want to have the ability to get an overview of what data there is, to visualise your data, to see a history of what you did to the data, or simply be able to re-run certain analysis steps, over and over again. This is when the console approach should give way to an IDE approach. IDE stands for integrated development envirnoment, or simply a graphical user interface that boosts the possibilities to interact with R.

RStudio is available for almost all computer platforms. It integrates all relevant tools for R in one programme. It supports multiple projects, versioning tools (like git), interactive grapics and generating many different types of documents.

RStudio offers syntax highlighting (indicating for example parentheses pairs, function names, characters versus numbers, etc.), auto completion of object and function names, and auto indention (indentation of code after line breaks at the right position).

**Basic layout**

When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:

  * The interactive R console (entire left)
  * Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

![RStudio layout](../fig/01-rstudio.png)

Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open
in the top left.

## A few "magic keys"

RStudio is built to make working with R very efficient. It minimises the amount of time you have to take your hands off the keyboard, for example to grab your mouse. There are a few "magic keys" your will rely on heavily: <kbd>Tab</kbd>, <kbd>Up</kbd>, <kbd>Down</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>Return</kbd>. Combinations of those make life easy and efficients, once you have learnt getting used to them.

* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+ <kbd>Return</kbd>  (or <kbd>&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> on OS X) runs a line (or function) of code. If you mark several lines of code, before, this selected code section will be run.
* <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> runs an entire script at once.
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd> moves the cursor to the script window.
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd> moves the cursor to the console window.

RStudio offers you great flexibility in running code from within the editor window. Apart from the key combinations,  there are buttons and menu choices.

## Work flow within RStudio
There are two main ways one can work within RStudio.

1. Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into
a .R file to run later.
   *  This works well when doing small tests and initially starting off.
   *  It quickly becomes laborious
2. Start writing in an .R file and use RStudio's short cut keys for the Run command
to push the current line, selected lines or modified lines to the
interactive R console.
   * This is a great way to start; all your code is saved for later
   * You will be able to run the file you create from within RStudio
   or using R's `source()`  function.
   
## Projects in RStudio

When working on different projects, things can easily get messy. RStudio offers so called projects. Projects are self consistent R sessions, including all objects, work spaces, scripts and histories. They support consistent and efficient work, and quick switches between different projects. 

You can initialise a new project via: Menu File > New Project > New Directory > New Project.

## Using R as a calculator

The simplest thing you could do with R is do arithmetic:

```{r}
1 + 100
```

And R will print out the answer, with a preceding "[1]". Don't worry about this
for now, we'll explain that later. For now think of it as indicating output.

Like bash, if you type in an incomplete command, R will wait for you to
complete it:

~~~
> 1 +
~~~
{: .r}

~~~
+
~~~
{: .output}

Any time you hit return and the R session shows a "+" instead of a ">", it
means it's waiting for you to complete the command. If you want to cancel
a command you can simply hit "Esc" and RStudio will give you back the ">"
prompt.

> ## Tip: Cancelling commands
>
> If you're using R from the commandline instead of from within RStudio,
> you need to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> instead of <kbd>Esc</kbd>
> to cancel the command. This applies to Mac users as well!
>
> Cancelling a command isn't only useful for killing incomplete commands:
> you can also use it to tell R to stop running code (for example if it's
> taking much longer than you expect), or to get rid of the code you're
> currently writing.
>
{: .callout}

When using R as a calculator, the order of operations is the same as you
would have learned back in school.

```{r}
3 + 5 * 2
```

versus:

```{r}
(3 + 5) * 2
```

Really small or large numbers get a scientific notation:

```{r}
2/10000
```

Which is shorthand for "multiplied by `10^XX`". So `2e-4` is shorthand for `2 * 10^(-4)`.

You can write numbers in scientific notation too:

```{r}
5e3  # Note the lack of minus here
```

## Mathematical functions

R has many built in mathematical functions. To call a function,
we simply type its name, followed by  open and closing parentheses.
Anything we type inside the parentheses is called the function's
arguments:

```{r}
sin(1)  # trigonometry functions
```

```{r}
log(1)  # natural logarithm
```

```{r}
exp(0.5) # e^(1/2)
```

Don't worry about trying to remember every function in R. You
can simply look them up on Google, or if you can remember the
start of the function's name, use the tab completion in RStudio.

Typing a `?` before the name of a command will open the help page
for that command. As well as providing a detailed description of
the command and how it works, scrolling to the bottom of the
help page will usually show a collection of code examples which
illustrate command usage. We'll go through an example later.

## Variables and assignment

We can store values in variables using the assignment operator `<-`, like this:

```{r}
x <- 1/40
```

It is also possible to use the `=` operator for assignment:

```{r}
x = 1/40
```

But this is much less common among R users.  The most important thing is to
**be consistent** with the operator you use. There are occasionally places
where it is less confusing to use `<-` than `=`, and it is the most common
symbol used in the community. So the recommendation is to use `<-`.

Notice that assignment does not print a value. Instead, we stored it for later
in something called a **variable**. `x` now contains the **value** `0.025`:

```{r}
x
```

Look for the `Environment` tab in one of the panes of RStudio, and you will see that `x` and its value have appeared. Our variable `x` can be used in place. Assignment values can also contain the variable being assigned to:

```{r}
x <- x + 1 # notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
y <- x * 2
```

Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods. They cannot start with a number nor contain spaces at all. Different people use different conventions for long variable names, these include

  * periods.between.words
  * underscores\_between_words
  * camelCaseToSeparateWords

What you use is up to you, but **be consistent**.

{: .challenge}

## Managing your environment

There are a few useful commands you can use to interact with the R session.

`ls` will list all of the variables and functions stored in the global environment
(your working R session):

```{r}
ls()
```

> ## Tip: hidden objects
>
> Like in the shell, `ls` will hide any variables or functions starting
> with a "." by default. To list all objects, type `ls(all.names=TRUE)`
> instead
>
{: .callout}

Note here that we didn't give any arguments to `ls`, but we still
needed to give the parentheses to tell R to call the function.

If we type `ls` by itself, R will print out the source code for that function!

```{r}
ls
```

You can use `rm` to delete objects you no longer need:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(x)
```

If you have lots of things in your environment and want to delete all of them,
you can pass the results of `ls` to the `rm` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
```

In this case we've combined the two. Like the order of operations, anything
inside the innermost parentheses is evaluated first, and so on.

In this case we've specified that the results of `ls` should be used for the
`list` argument in `rm`. When assigning values to arguments by name, you *must*
use the `=` operator!!

If instead we use `<-`, there will be unintended side effects, or you may get an error message:

```{r, error=TRUE}
rm(list <- ls())
```

## R Packages

It is possible to add functions to R by using additional packages. As of this writing, there are over 10,000 packages available on CRAN (the comprehensive R archive network).

Functions are contained in packages, and packages are contained in your library. Thus, you load a package from your library to make the functions therein available.

R and RStudio have functionalities for managing packages:

* You can see what packages are installed by typing
  `installed.packages()`
* You can install packages by typing `install.packages("packagename")`,
  where `packagename` is the package name, in quotes.
* You can update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
* You can remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
* You can make a package available for use with `library(packagename)`
